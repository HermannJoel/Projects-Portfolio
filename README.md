Examples of real life data machine learning projects to showcase my programming and data science skills 

# [PROJECT 1: BULLDOZER SALE PRICE PREDICTION USING LINEAR REGRESSION: Project Overview](https://github.com/HermannJoel/Finance/tree/main/Bulldozer%20Sale%20Price%20Prediction)

* The techniques used in here have been inspired and adapted from [Mrbourke]()
* Created a regression model that predict the future sale price of a bulldozer based given its characteristics previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold     for.
* There are 3 datasets:
  Train.csv - Historical bulldozer sales examples up to 2011 (close to 400,000 examples with 50+ different attributes, including SalePrice which is the target variable).
  Valid.csv - Historical bulldozer sales examples from January 1 2012 to April 30 2012 (close to 12,000 examples with the same attributes as Train.csv).
  Test.csv - Historical bulldozer sales examples from May 1 2012 to November 2012 (close to 12,000 examples but missing the SalePrice attribute, as this is what we'll be trying    to predict).
* The main performance metric is the RMSLE(Rot Mean Squarred Log Error)  
* Find Hypertuning parameter using RandomizedSearchcv
* Trained and test the model with sales data up to 2011 and validated the model with sales data from May 1 2012 to November 2012 and succeded to predict buldozer price with a
  RMSLE of $xxxK
